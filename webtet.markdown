[WebTET](http://webtet.net) (Web-based Technical Ear Trainer) is an online platform for teaching critical listening skills to sound engineers. The student-facing half of the site, freely accessible at [webtet.net](http://webtet.net), allows engineers to practice aurally identifying control parameters for popular audio effects. The pages for dyanmics compression effects and parametric EQ effects are show below. The institutional half of the site, currently in a private beta release, allows instructors to create exercises and exams and track their students' progress on these tasks.
