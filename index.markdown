<a href="https://webtet.net/" class="small-image">![webtet](images/webtet.png)</a>  [WebTET](https://webtet.net/) (Web-based Technical Ear Trainer) is an application to teach critical listening skills to sound engineers. It is the companion software to a [popular textbook](https://www.amazon.com/Production-Critical-Listening-Engineering-Presents/dp/1138845949). A free version is accessed by thousands of users each month; an institutional version is used by a half-dozen leading universities, colleges and conservatories in North America and Europe.    
  
    


<a href="https://virb.herokuapp.com/" class="add-u"><img src="images/virb.png" alt="virb"/> </a>  <a href="https://virb.herokuapp.com/" class="add-u">VIRB</a> (Visual Impulse Response Browser) is a graphical search interface for collections of virtual acoustic spaces. Each space is displayed as an icon whose visual properties (e.g. colour, size, distance) reflect its acoustic properties (e.g. brilliance, reverberance, clarity). It builds on research reported in my [dissertation](/images/DHB_dissertation.pdf).
