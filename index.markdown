<a href="https://webtet.net/" class="small-image">![webtet](images/webtet.png)</a>  [WebTET](https://webtet.net/) (Web-based Technical Ear Trainer) is an application to teach critical listening skills to sound engineers. It is the companion software to a [popular textbook](https://www.amazon.com/Production-Critical-Listening-Engineering-Presents/dp/1138845949). A free version is accessed by thousands of users monthly and an institutional version is used by a half-dozen leading universities, colleges and conservatories in North America and Europe.    
  
    


<a href="https://virb.herokuapp.com/">![webtet](images/virb.png)</a>  [VIRB](https://virb.herokuapp.com/) (Visual Impulse Response Browser) is a graphical search interface for collections of virtual acoustic spaces. Each space is shown as an icon whose visual properties (e.g. colour, size, distance) reflect its acoustic properties (e.g. brilliance, reverberance, clarity). It builds on research reported in my [dissertation](/images/DHB_dissertation.pdf).
