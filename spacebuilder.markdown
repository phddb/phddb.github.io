Spacebuilder is a software tool for visually and aurally exploring the Spacebuilder Library, likely the world's largest collection of high-resolution room impulse responses (16000+ items). It is intended for use as a search interface for reverberation effects in audio production contexts. The software is currently in development not yet publically available, but an early version is described in detail [here](http://publications.rwth-aachen.de/record/770331/files/770331.pdf). Two screenshots from this early version are shown below.
